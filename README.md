# Assignment: Brushing and Linking

This assignment will help you get started with brushing and linking. Please look through all these materials so you understand how to run and organize your code.

## Setup

**Under no circumstances should you be editing files via the GitHub user interface.** Do all your edits locally after cloning the repository.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. E.g., in your terminal / command prompt `CD` to where you want this the folder for this activity to be. Then run `git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>`

1. `CD` or open a terminal / command prompt window into the cloned folder.

1. Start a simple python webserver. E.g., one of these commands:
    * `python -m http.server 8000`
    * `python3 -m http.server 8000`
    * `py -m http.server 8000`
    
    If you are using Python 2 you will need to use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` instead, but please switch to Python 3 as [Python 2 will be sunset on 2020.01.01](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/).

1. Wait for the output: `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/)`

1. Now open your web browser (Firefox or Chrome) and navigate to the URL: http://localhost:8000

## Organization

### Root Files
* `README.md` is this explanatory file for the repo.

* `index.html` contains the main website content.

* `style.css` contains the CSS.

* `LICENCE` is your source code license.

### Folders
Each folder has an explanatory `README.md` file.

* `data` holds the data file for the visualization, `texas.json`.

* `favicons` contains the favicons for the web page. You shouldn't change anything here.

* `js` will contain all JavaScript files you write. E.g.,

  * `visualization.js` is the main code that builds all your visualizations.

  * `scatterplot.js` is the code for creating a scatterplot using a [Reusable Chart model](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/).

  * `linechart.js` is the code for creating a line chart using a [Reusable Chart model](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/).

* `lib` will contain any JavaScript library you use. It currently includes D3.

## Instructions

You will be creating a new table that is connected to the existing scatterplot and line chart using brushing and linking.
Make your edits and commit major versions to your git repository.
**Under no circumstances should you be editing files via the GitHub user interface.** 

1. In `index.html` update the GitHub repo URL with the URL of your repository. It is in the span with `id="forkongithub"`.

1. Following the [Reusable Chart model](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) set out in `scatterplot.js` and `linechart.js`, implement the code in `js/table.js` necessary for creating a table of all the data in `data/texas.json`. E.g., a header with the four columns for `year`, `poverty`, `unemployment`, and `murder` followed by `22` rows of data like so:

    | year | poverty | unemployment | murder |
    |-----:|--------:|-------------:|-------:|
    | 1996 | 16.6    | 7.7          | 5.7    |
    | 1997 | 16.7    | 6.8          | 5.3    |
    | ...  | ...     | ...          | ...    |

1. Add any necessary CSS to `style.css` for displaying your table.

1. Add brushing and highlighting functionality to your table to match both function and style of the scatterplot and line chart.

1. Add code to `js/visualization.js` to create the three-way brushing and linking between the table, line chart, and scatterplot. E.g., selections in any of the three should highlight the associated data marks in **all three** visualizations.

1. Ensure your code passes the [W3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

The final interaction should look like this (without the concentric red rings on click):

## Submission Instructions

1. Submit a URL to your repository to [the associated assignment on Latte](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=2706678), as well as a PDF of a writeup with screenshots of your application, and a description (2-3 sentences) of how your linking works.  This should be a semantic description of the internal implementation, i.e. when I click and drag the mouse over rows of the table, X happens, which causes Y to happen in the other views.  Also use the writeup to tell us if anything isn't working and how you think you might have gotten it working.

## Tips and Tricks

### How to write a table to the DOM using D3

D3 is not just an SVG data binding and manipulation library, though that is what most of the examples show.
It is actually a general-purpose DOM data binding and manipulation library.
You can thus use it to manipulate arbitrary HTML tags too, e.g., the tags for tables: `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>`.

You can [search for at examples online](https://www.google.com/search?&q=d3+html+table), e.g., Jonah Williams' [Interactive HTML Table I](http://bl.ocks.org/jonahwilliams/cc2de2eedc3896a3a96d).
Note that this is using D3 version 3 while you are using D3 version 4, so some changes may be necessary.

### Function/method chaining

D3, and this exercise, use [function chaining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining) to apply several changes to the same visualization.

You don't have to use chaining.
E.g., instead of this:
```js
d3.select("body")
  .append("p")
    .text("Hello, world!");
```
you can write:
```js
var body = d3.select("body");
var p = body.append("p");
p.text("Hello, world!");
```

### JS statements: let vs. var vs. const

To make our code more modular, reusable, and error-free we are limiting variable scope to the relevant parts of the code.
In part, we do this by using [`let` statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) instead of [`var`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var) by default so as to not set global variables.
We are also using [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) to create read-only references.

### ES6 Arrow functions `=>`

Note that this exercise uses the [ES6 Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).
E.g., instead of writing `function(d){ return d.name; }` we write `d => d.name` or `d => { return d.name; }`. We would use the latter version with surrounding `{...}` when we need multiple lines of code vs. just a simple expression.

### How to implement interaction on the table

[`d3.brush`](https://github.com/d3/d3-brush) would be hard to use directly atop an HTML `table`, so we need to use a little custom functionality. Instead, think about how you can re-create similar functionality by listening for DOM events. D3's `d3-selection` module can listen for any of the [standard DOM events](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#handling-events) using the `selection.on(typenames[, listener[, options]])` function.

E.g., to provide row highlighting on mouseover a la Jonah Williams' [Interactive HTML Table I](http://bl.ocks.org/jonahwilliams/cc2de2eedc3896a3a96d) you can listen for [Mouse Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events#Mouse_events) like so:
```js
d3.selectAll("tr")
    .on("mouseover", (d, i, elements) => {
      d3.select(elements[i]).classed("highlighted", true)
    })
    .on("mouseout", (d, i, elements) => {
      d3.select(elements[i]).classed("highlighted", false)
    });
```
This uses the ES6 Arrow functions `=>` (see above).
Note that using the arrow functions we are not able to use `d3.select(this)` like you see in many esp. older D3 examples.
See [this post](https://medium.com/@yonester/on-d3-and-arrow-functions-b6559c1cebb8) for a discussion.

### How we are sending selection updated events

D3 has a module [`d3-dispatch`](https://github.com/d3/d3-dispatch) for emiting and listening for events, which we use to coordinate selection updates between our linked views.

E.g.,
```js
let dispatcher = d3.dispatch("selectionUpdated");
dispatcher.on("selectionUpdated", callback1);
```
However, to have multiple listeners for that same event you would need to have unique suffixes for the same string beginning with '`.`'.
E.g., to have both the line chart and table listening to scatterplot updates we could have
```js
dispatcher.on("selectionUpdated.sp-to-lc", callback1);
dispatcher.on("selectionUpdated.sp-to-tab", callback1);
```
where `"sp-to-lc"` and `"sp-to-tab"` are arbitrary but written here to be informative.

## Grading

You will receive full marks if:
